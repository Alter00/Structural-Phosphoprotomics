# Structural-Phosphoprotomics

All structural analysis codes are given for Structural Analysis of Mammalian Protein Phosphorylation at a Proteome Level. Each process is separated into different python files to decrease the complexity of files. 

Processes include matching pre-editing of phosphoproteomics data, pre-editing of structural data, matching of phospho-site with respective structural information, NMR and multiple X-ray structure analysis, random forest classifier for functionality detection of phospho-sites, and statistical analysis of results.

Needed files can be found in following drive link:
